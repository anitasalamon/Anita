## Experience 
### Bioinformatics / statistics


- Deep experience with software tools for next-generation high-throughput DNA
sequencing data, including:
  * sequence alignment (e.g.
    [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net),
    [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), etc.)
  * post-alignment analysis (e.g.
    [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net),
    [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.)
